# OmniSocial

A Rails 3.1 engine for Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn logins using [OmniAuth](http://github.com/jsmestad/omniauth)

## Notice

This branch is only compatible with Ruby 1.9.x and Rails 3.1.0. It may
work with others, but I have not had time to test against these yet.

## Installation

To use OmniSocial in a Rails 3.1 application:

1. Require it in the Gemfile: `gem 'omnisocial'`

2. Install it by running `bundle`.

Some more detailed installation instructions are in the [project announcement article](http://icelab.com.au/articles/welcome-to-the-omnisocial/).
